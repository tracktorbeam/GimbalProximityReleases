        <h1>Beacons</h1>
        <p>
        	The Gimbal Proximity Beacon is a BLE powered device that provides context about proximity and also ambient temperature.  They broadcast a rolling encrypted code to ensure only users with the correct privileges can see the beacon's information.  The beacons are configured to transmit at a rate that optimizes reactiveness on applications and battery-life of the beacons.  They come in two form factors: Series 10 and Series 20.

Depending on the <a href="#visibility">visibility</a> level of the application and ownership of the beacon, more information about the beacon (including a given name, temperature and RSSI value) can be displayed.

    <div class="span12">

        <h1>Sightings</h1>
        <p>
        	 A sighting occurs when a Proximity Enabled Application receives a BLE packet from a proximate beacon.  Depending on the <a href="#visibility">visibility</a> of the application, the Gimbal Proximity SDK notifies the application of the sighting. It will contain information about the event such as: RSSI value, Beacon Name, Icon Url, Battery Level, and Temperature.  The application can then react to the sighting by showing a coupon deal, displaying information about the current location, or giving a customized greeting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Gimbal Proximity SDK, in addition to notifying the application, also notifies the Gimbal Manager Servers periodically of all sightings.  The Gimbal Manager Servers can then provide analytics data to third-party developer servers through a <a href="rest.html#sightings_callback">REST interface</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sightings passed to the application are real-time and can be referred to as <strong>client-side sightings</strong>.  Sightings received by the Gimbal Manager Servers can be referred to as <strong>server-side sightings</strong>.  These sightings are not real-time and are meant for analytics, such as historical sightings of beacons.

        <div id="visits" class="row-fluid api_row">
    <div style="height: 40px;"></div>
    <div class="span12">

        <h1>Visits</h1>
        <p>
        	A common use case of Proximity is to treat a beacon as a micro-fence that triggers arrival and departure events.  This allows a developer to know when a user is near a particular location and for how long they dwelled.  This concept is referred to as a Visit in the SDK.
        </p>
        <p>
            The life cycle of a visit is:
            <ol>
                <li>Arrival (First sighting)</li>
                <li>Sighted (One or more sightings)</li>
                <li>Departure (No longer sighted)</li>
            </ol>
            After receiving an arrival event, the application will be updated about the ongoing visit every time a new <a href="#sighting">sighting</a> is received.  The update will contain the current dwell time and RSSI of the most current sighting.   When the application no longer sights the beacon after a certain amount of time, the departure event is triggered.
        </p>
        <p>
            A visit has the following characteristics that affect the life cycle:
            <ul>
                <li>Arrival RSSI</li>
                <li>Departure RSSI</li>
                <li>Departure Interval</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Arrival RSSI</dt>
            <dd>This value affects the arrival event.  Only sightings that have an RSSI value of "Arrival RSSI" or higher is considered an arrival.  If this value is not set, any RSSI value will trigger an arrival event.</dd>
            <dt>Departure RSSI</dt>
            <dd>This value affects the departure event.  Sightings with an RSSI value greater than the "Departure RSSI" are considered proximate.  Sightings with an RSSI value of "Departure RSSI" or lower are not considered to be in proximity.  Although the SDK may still detect the beacon, it considers the beacon 'out of range' with respect to the visit.  If this value is not set, the SDK will consider any beacon it detects as in-range, regardless of the RSSI value.</dd>
            <dt>Departure Interval</dt>
            <dd>This value determines how long a beacon is 'out of range' to be considered departed.  When the beacon has been 'out of range' for longer than this interval, the visit's life cycle ends and a departure event is triggered.  Any new sightings for this beacon will start a new visit.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Much like sightings, there are <strong>client-side visits</strong> and <strong>server-side visits</strong>.  Client-side visits are real-time events. The visit characteristics can be configured via the SDK.  Server-side visits are not real-time as the SDK periodically posts sightings to the Gimbal Server to preserve battery life.  They can further be impacted by the device's network connectivity.  A developer can tune server-side visits via <a href="#rules">rules</a>.

    <div class="span12">

        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>
        	A rule gives a developer the ability to receive notifications of <a href="#visits">server-side visits</a>.  Depending on the application's <a href="#visibility">visibility</a>, when the SDK <a href="#sightings">sights</a> a beacon, it sends this sighting to the Gimbal Manager Server. It will then determine if the sighting matches a developer's rule.  Upon a rule match, the Gimbal Manager Server notifies the developer's server of visit events through the configured "Sighting Callback URL."

                <h3>Creating a Rule</h3>

                <p>
                    To create a rule, visit the Gimbal Manager and navigate to the Proximity->Rules section. Click on "New Rule" to see the screen below:

                <p>
                    The characteristics of a rule are as follows:
                    <dl>
                        <dt>App Title</dt>
                        <dd>Required: The title of an application owned by the developer.</dd>
                        <dt>Sighting Message Frequency</dt>
                        <dd>Required: This is the interval, in seconds, at which the Gimbal Manager will send a Sighting event to the server at "Sighting Callback URL."</dd>
                        <dt>Exit Interval</dt>
                        <dd>Required: This is the elapsed time, in seconds, that determines when a visit is closed.  If no sighting reaches the Gimbal Server within the Exit Interval, the visit is considered departed.  The departure event is then sent to the callback URL.</dd>
                        <dt>Entry Signal Strength</dt>
                        <dd>Optional: If supplied, only sightings whose values are "Entry Signal Strength" or larger will trigger an arrival event.</dd>
                        <dt>Exit Signal Strength</dt>
                        <dd>Optional: If supplied, sightings whose values are "Entry Signal Strength" or smaller will be ignored for visit processing and will act similar to have not being sighted.</dd>
                        <dt>Sighting Callback URL</dt>
                        <dd>Optional: This is the URL to the <a href="rest.html#sightings_callback"> Sighting Callback</a> endpoint hosted by the developer to which all visit events are sent.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    As mentioned earlier, the SDK sights every beacon in proximity but the beacons are filtered up to the app by their visibility.  Although the sightings are filtered at the application level, the SDK still sends <strong><i>all sightings</i></strong> to the Gimbal Manager Server.  Therefore it is possible for a sighting to match against multiple rules on the Gimbal Manager Server, even across applications by different developers.  This means that server-side visits can be generated from sightings posted by other applications.  To limit rule-matching to sightings that originate only from the same application, select the check box labeled "Only notify when sightings is from the app selected".

            While creating a <a href="https://proximity.gimbal.com/developer/applications/new">new Proximity API Key</a> you can set your application's visibility options.  These options determine the ability of your application to <a href="#sightings">sight</a> beacons and also how the server matches <a href="#rules"> rules </a> for <a href="#visits">server-side visits</a>.
